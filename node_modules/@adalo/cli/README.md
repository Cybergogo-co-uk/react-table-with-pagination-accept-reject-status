# Adalo CLI

## Dev Server

The dev server allows you to develop components locally, and test them in the Adalo editor, without having to publish your packages.

### Dev Server Usage

From your component repo, run:

```
npx adalo dev
```

Then from the editor, reload the page, and look under the "Add Layer" menu. You should see your local components available to add to your project.

**Note:** if you want to use a different dev-server than the default one, set `ADALO_DEV_SERVER=https://...`
